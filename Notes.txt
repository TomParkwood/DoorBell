By the look of it i don't need to use a wireless reciever.
Just using a switch and connect the top side of the switch to GPIO 6  and the other side to ground.
The GPIO 21 connects to the led which then has a 220 ohm resistor in line which then goes to ground.
The ground line then connects to the ground pin on the PI.

Need to use the pushingbox API to send out the notifications, this was so much easier than trying with the old pushbullet api which has 0 documentation.
Need to first create a pushbullet account and generate an api key.
then a pushingbox account
create a service for pushbullet and give it a name and put the api key into it.
Create a new scenario and give it the message you want to be displayed.
The device ID is what you want to be included in the code as the devid in data.

Please note that there is a limit of 1000 messages a day using pushingbox so dont use it for high volume messages.
