Raspberry Pi
Doorbell switch or wireless doorbell
If wireless then 433 MHz reciever
pull down resistor

configure to send out notifications

PushBullet
https://github.com/randomchars/pushbullet.py

I have written the code which should work, i have included printing and an LED for testing however this maybe unnecessary on the final product.
Need to setup the PI for WiFi,
install python, pushbullet and import the code from github
run the code and test without the notifications first
when the led and printing works then enable notifications 

su
apt-get install python-dev
apt-get install python-rpi.dpio
apt-get install git
